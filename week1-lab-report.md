# **Week 1 Lab Report**
This lab report will be a tutorial for myself and future CSE 15L students who are trying to log onto our course-specific accounts on ieng6.

Step 1: Installing VScode
---
* For this step, I first went onto the [VScode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to download and install visual studio code.
* Then I went to the [Git website](https://gitforwindows.org/) to download Git for windows.
* VScode should looke something like this after setting it up properly:

Step 2: Remotely Connecting 
---
* After setting up VScode, I starting setting up the remote connection on VScode.
* FIrst, I pressed `` Ctrl+Shift+` `` to open the terminal on VScode. This should look like this:

* Then I typed `ssh cs15lwi23aqq@ifeng6.ucsd.edu` in the terminal. (If you are logging into your own account, replace the `aqq` part with letters from **your own** username)
* After that, the terminal asked me if I wanted to connect to my host, and I simply answered **yes**.
* Then I typed my CSE 15L specific password into the terminal in the password section. (Note that it is normal that the password you typed doesnt show due to privacy reasons) 
* Finally, I pressed enter and this is what it should look like:

Step 3: Trying Some Commands
---
* Now the terminal should be connected to a remote computer in the CSE department.
* I then tested out a few lines of codes including:
*  * cd~
