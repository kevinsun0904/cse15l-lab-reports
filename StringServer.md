# Week 3 Lab Report
For this lab report, I wrote a java program which starts a localhost server that can take in queries to add to a string list with the URL and display the elements in the list. 
## Part 1
The following is the code for my StringServer:

-In my code, the StringServer class is mainly used to take in the port number when running the server, and starting the server properly.
-The Handler class is used to handle any requests or queries typed in the URL, and outputs "404 not found" if the path or query is not specified.
